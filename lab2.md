#### WEB APPLICATION HACKING

Consider the five classes of web attacks. How can these be used to compromise each of the above applications?

1. Web Server
 * Can the application be subverted to gain access to the hardware?
 * Can the application be forced to execute arbitrary code on the server?

2. Web Client
 * Will your web browser execute arbitrary code from this application?
 * If the application asks you to install software, will you allow it?

3. Web Application
 * Can authentication logic on the application be bypassed?
 * Can authorization controls on the application be bypassed?
 * Can the application be forced to leak information to an attacker?

4. Web User
 * Can this application be used to manipulate you?
 * Can you manipulate others’ thoughts through this application?
 * Can you manipulate others’ behaviors through this application?

5. Network
 * How exposed is network traffic from the application?
 * How would intercepting or tampering with that traffic affect it?

6. This concludes this block of instruction.
